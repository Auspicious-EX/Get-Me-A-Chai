## Get Me a Chai â˜•

Get Me a Chai is a web platform designed for developers who need funds to complete their projects. Fans and supporters can contribute financially to help these developers bring their ideas to life. The website is built using **Next.js** and **SCSS**, with **Auth.js** for authentication and **Razorpay** integration for secure payment processing.

### Key Features

- **Project Funding**: Developers can create a profile, list their projects, and provide details such as project name, description, and a link to learn more. Supporters can then contribute funds directly to their project.
- **Authentication**: Built-in user authentication using **Auth.js**, allowing developers to manage their project listings securely.
- **Payment Integration**: Supports payments through **Razorpay**, requiring developers to set up a Razorpay account to receive contributions. Developers must generate a Razorpay client ID and secret to start receiving funds.
- **Refund Policy**: Developers are responsible for managing refunds based on their policies.
